## Robotic Arm
In this project, we used the <b>PUMA 560</b> robotic manipulator. PUMA 560, was used in 1985 in a stereotaxic operation, in which computed tomography was used to guide the robot as it inserted a needle into the brain for biopsy, a procedure previously subject to error from hand tremors during needle placement.

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Mega
- Personal Computer with MATLAB Installed
